  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This is a recipe by Molly Baz. We discovered her book at the beginning of the year (2023) and have cooked a handful of the recipes inside. Out of all of them, this one is our absolute favorite</p> 
<p>and we would cook it every single night if it wasnt for the smell that lingers in the house for a few days. If our home didnt have terrible air flow and scallops werent so expensive, this meal would be a weekly staple in our house. </p>
<p>Currently we eat it about once a month. The smell is totally worth it and I highly recommend that every single person make these at least once. The secret to this recipe is using a H O T pan and searing the scallops fast and hard.</p>
<p> A cast iron skillet is definitely preferred. I hope you enjoy these as much as we do!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>3 ears of corn, husked</li>
  <li>3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
  <li>2 oz. smoked Spanish chorizo, finely chopped</li>
  <li>12 scallions, white and pale green parts only, thinly sliced</li>
  <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
  <li>½ serrano chile (depending on heat), finely chopped</li>
  <li>¾ tsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
  <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
  <li>⅓ cup chopped cilantro</li>
  <li>12 large sea scallops (about 1 lb.), side muscle removed, patted dry</li>
  <li>2 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
  <li>1 lime, halved</li>
  <li>Lime wedges (for serving)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Cut kernels from corncobs and place in a medium bowl. Using the back of a chef’s knife, scrape milk from cobs into the bowl; discard cobs.</li>
  <li>Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium saucepan over medium. Cook chorizo, stirring occasionally, until it starts to get crisp, about 2 minutes. Carefully pour chorizo oil into a small bowl (use a slotted spoon to hold back chorizo); set chorizo oil aside. Return chorizo pan to medium heat and add scallions, garlic, chile, 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and ¾ tsp. salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add corn kernels and cook, stirring occasionally, until bright yellow and softened, 5–7 minutes. Remove from heat and let corn mixture cool in pan 5 minutes. Gently mix in buttermilk and cilantro. Taste and season with more salt if needed.</li>

  <li>Divide corn mixture among plates and arrange scallops on top. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.</li>
