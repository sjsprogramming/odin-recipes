  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>These chocolate chip brownies are so easy and simple to make. You only need a few ingredients to get started! You just need 2 eggs, some cocoa powder, then the rest of the ingredients are probably already inside of your pantry! Theres are so quick and easy to make, especially if you have a stand mixer! These are always my go to guilty pleasure! I hope you enjoy!
  </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
    <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
    <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>
  <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
  <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
  <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.</li>
</ol>
